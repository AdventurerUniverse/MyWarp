==========

MyWarp is a dynamic and social warping plugin for bukkit. It allows you to:

* Create private and public warps,
* Invite and uninvite players or whole permission-groups to warps or make them public so everyone can use them,
* List all warps you can use and profit from the intelligent mechanism that determines warp-names based on name-parts,
* Use creation-limits to regulate how many warps of a type a user can make,
* Create warmups and/or cooldowns to regulate warp-usage even more,
* Regulate access to warps based on worlds,
* Create warp signs and connect them to buttons or levers,
* Charge your users for using, creating, listing or any other warp-related task via Vault,
* Translate every message the plugin outputs, either so it fits your servers theme of even into a whole new language,
* Show warps on Dynmap using the built-in support.
